# Local Development

`cd public_html_fmh`
`php -S localhost:8000`

Then, go to http://localhost:8000/localtest.php

to run a local test.

# To Publish

Send new `apis/*` files and updated `apis.js` to client, who will upload them to the server.
(First time, will need to update status.php to include call to apis.js instead of embedded code.)
